Weight: 210lbs
Height: 5'11"
Bench Press PR: 235lbs

Deadlift PR: 360lbs
The JSON should include:
A 'weeklyRoutine' array containing 7 day objects
Each day object should have:
'day' (string)
'focus' (array of strings)
'tips' (array of 3 strings)
'exercises' (array of exercise objects)
Each exercise object should include:
'name' (string)

'rest' (string)
'tip' (string)
'notes' (string, if applicable)
'recommendedWeight' (string or null)
'videoLink' (string URL to a demonstration video)
'picture' (string URL to an image of the exercise pulled from the web)
For compound lifts (bench press, squat, deadlift, overhead press), use a '5,5,5,5,5+' rep scheme and include detailed notes on how to perform and progress with this scheme.
Provide recommended weights for exercises based on the user's PRs. If a recommendation can't be given, use null.
For the 'Sunday' recovery day, include a 'Knee Mobility Exercises' section with its own array of exercises, each containing:
'name' (string)
'sets' (number)
'reps' (string)
'description' (string)

Tailor the exercises, sets, reps, and intensity based on the user's stats and PRs. Ensure the routine is balanced and includes appropriate progression and recovery. Focus on exercises that will help improve the user's bench press, squat, and deadlift PRs while also incorporating overall fitness and knee mobility work.
